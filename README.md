ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Karlo.

I like my data complex, well-structured, and able to power a day full of insights. From the art of engineering robust ETL pipelines to the thrill of diving into raw datasets, I enjoy turning messy information into actionable, story-rich data.

I enjoy finding patterns where others see chaos and building systems that make data not only useful but also beautiful. Whether it's wrangling SQL queries, crafting Python scripts, or creating aesthetic and insighful data visualizations, my goal is always the same: turn data into decisions.

I see data engineering as the unsung hero of analysisâ€”after all, behind every meaningful insight is a well-built pipeline that ensured the data got there in the first place. Itâ€™s a bit like solving puzzles, but the pieces are bytes, and the reward is better business outcomes, or maybe even just a cleaner dataset (which is just as exciting).

When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in a codebase, Iâ€™m likely exploring new ways to make data tell stories that matterâ€”because, at the end of the day, data doesn't just drive businesses; it drives curiosity, creativity, and change.

Thanks for stopping by!
