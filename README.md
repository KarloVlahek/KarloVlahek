Hi, I’m Karlo!
I am currently a student at UT Austin pursuing a masters in Economics.
I'm learning a lot here, but my experiences (and passions) boil down to taking data and telling stories for anyone to consider, regardless of their background!
I post my code here from previous projects spanning various questions I attempt to answer
I am a big fan of data visualtization and its ability to paint pictures through (sometimes) seemingly complex data. Not everyone can read and interpret code, but everyone can appreciate its results through a lens of digestible information. 
Thanks for stopping by!
